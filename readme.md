## Synopsis

This project uses blockchain technology to create public or private, decentralised forums where messages are archived and stored among forum users. The project ultimately provides a solution to the problem of today's current messaging platforms in which our private communications are mediated by potentially untrustworthy or unreliable 3rd parties.

## Code Example

No code examples yet.

## Motivation

The purpose of this project is to explore the potential of blockchain technology in the area of public and private messaging through the development of a blockchain forum application involving:

* The implementation of a blockchain suited for decentralized management and distribution of forum transactions. 
* A serverless design to capitalise on the privacy afforded by a decentralised blockchain.
* A cohesive and streamlined interface for interacting with the forum.
